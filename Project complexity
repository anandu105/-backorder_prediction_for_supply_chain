Since this is an imbalanced classification problem having positive class points very less we have to choose performance metrics accordingly. 
For this case false negative is a bigger concern than false-positive. Hence for this recall is more important for us than Precision. 
This is because it is okay to predict a product will go to back order than it is actually to back order as it can be dealt with easily. 
But it failed to predict product going to back order when it actually went to back order, it will be negatively impacting the company's sales and its reputation along 
with an additional pressure on the whole supply chain.
